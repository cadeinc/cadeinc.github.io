In 2014 CADE Inc. established the Thoralf Skolem Award to reward a CADE paper that has passed the test of time, by being a most influential paper in the field. Beginning with CADE-25 (2015), at every CADE the Skolem Award Committee selects a paper presented at the CADE held 10 years earlier to receive the Skolem award.

### Procedure

Every CADE has its own Skolem award committee, whose office terminates with the CADE for which it was appointed. The CADE board of trustees appoints the chair of the Skolem award committee, and the chair appoints the rest of the committee. The Skolem award committee evaluates the papers and selects those to be awarded, and the chair informs the CADE board of trustees of the final result. Under exceptional circumstances, two awards (ex aequo) or no award may be given.

In order to cover the entire history of CADE, beginning with CADE-25 (2015), in addition to the Skolem award to a paper presented at the CADE held 10 years earlier, every CADE conference offers three additional Skolem awards for papers presented at CADE's held approximately 20, 30, and 40 years earlier. Whenever a CADE offers multiple Skolem awards, one single Skolem award committee is responsible for all of them. The Skolem award schedule follows. On the account of their workshop status, a few very early CADE's are combined under one Skolem award.

* CADE-25 (2015) offers one Skolem award for CADE-20 (2005), one for CADE-14 (1997), one for CADE-8 (1986), and one for CADE-0 (1968) and CADE-1 (1975) considered jointly.
* CADE-26 (2017) offers one Skolem award for CADE-21 (2007), one for CADE-15 (1998), one for CADE-9 (1988), and one for CADE-2 (1976) and CADE-3 (1977) considered jointly.
* CADE-27 (2019) offers one Skolem award for CADE-22 (2009), one for CADE-16 (1999), one for CADE-10 (1990), and one for CADE-4 (1979).
* CADE-28 (2021) offers one Skolem award for CADE-23 (2011), one for CADE-17 (2000), one for CADE-11 (1992), and one for CADE-5 (1980).
* CADE-29 (2023) offers one Skolem award for CADE-24 (2013), one for CADE-18 (2002), one for CADE-12 (1994), and one for CADE-6 (1982).
* CADE-30 (2025) offers one Skolem award for CADE-25 (2015), one for CADE-19 (2003), one for CADE-13 (1996), and one for CADE-7 (1984).
* Steady state is reached in 2027 when CADE-32 offers only one Skolem award.

for the paper "An Optimal On-the-Fly Tableau-Based Decision Procedure for PDL-Satisfiability" published in the CADE-22 proceedings in 2009. The paper is recognised for presenting the first decision procedure for propositional dynamic logic which is both theoretically optimal and effective in practice. Previous decision procedures are either suboptimal in the worst case, or worst-case optimal but with poor average-case performance. The solution in this paper thereby closed a problem that had been open for almost 30 years.
