<h2>Nominees for the CADE Trustee Elections</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://aarinc.org/Newsletters/135-2021-07.html#election">Nominations for <b>two CADE trustee positions</b> were being
  sought</a>, in preparation for the elections to be held
  after CADE-28.
</p>

<p>The following candidates were nominated and their statements, in alphabetical order, are below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#claudia">Cl&aacute;udia Nalon</a>, nominated by Renate Schmidt and Christoph Benzm&uuml;ller</li>
  <li><a href="#stephan">Stephan Schulz</a>, nominated by Geoff Sutcliffe and Hans de Nivelle</li>
  <li><a href="#sophie">Sophie Tourret</a>, nominated by Uwe Waldmann and Pascal Fontaine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="claudia">Nominee statement of Cl&aacute;udia Nalon</h3>

<p>
I am honoured to be nominated to serve in the CADE's Board of Trustees. I have followed both CADE and IJCAR for many years, in person whenever I could. I have contributed research papers to both conferences, served as a PC member in several opportunities, and helped organising the first edition of CADE in South America.
</p>

<p>
The very first IJCAR was the very first major conference in AR that I attended. It was exciting then, it is still exciting today to taking part of these meetings. I believe that many would also benefit from the interaction with senior researchers, as I did myself in the early stages of my studies and career. I strongly support the continuation of the Bledsoe Award (that made possible my travelling to Sienna back in 2001), which allows students to attend the conferences, and the newly created Bill McCune's award, which gives visibility to younger researchers and their work in the field.
</p>

<p>
My research is focused on both the theoretical foundations and practical aspects related to the implementation of proof methods for non-classical logics and their combinations. I have developed and implemented proof systems for non-monotonic logics, many-valued logics, and for several modal logics (normal multimodal logics and their extensions, and parameterised multi-modal confluent logics; interacting epistemic and temporal modal logics; dynamic logics; non-normal modal logics for cooperative agency; preferential logics; etc). Working on theorem-proving for non-classical logics is interesting and challenging. It is also related to many non-trivial industrial applications. It is my intention as a trustee to stimulate the development of theories and tools for such challenging applications, which goes beyond the traditional focus of CADE in classical logics.
</p>

<p>
I believe the co-location with other major conferences should be continued as it is helpful in fostering further collaboration within the field. As an enthusiastic developer, who believes in the benefits of the fruitful synergy between theory and practice, I advocate for encouraging more submissions of both system's descriptions and research papers related to the practical aspects of automated reasoning. Finally, although boldly going to places where no conferences had gone before is not the motto for CADE, I very strongly believe that a better geographical distribution would be extremely beneficial to our community, helping to stimulate research and disseminate knowledge about AR, and also attracting the talented minds from several underrepresented regions into the field.
</p>


<h3 id="stephan">Nominee statement of Stephan Schulz</h3>

<p>
I am a tenured professor of computer science at DHBW Stuttgart in
Germany. In the CADE community I am probably best known for the
development of the theorem prover E (and the many systems build on and
around E), and the co-creation of the ES* and PAAR workshop series. I
became ex-officio trustee in my role as one of the IJCAR 2018 program
chairs, and I was elected to my first full term in 2018.
</p>

<p>
With the COVID pandemic, two both IJCAR 2020 and CADE 2021 had to move
to online formats. I think we learned a lot about the advantages and
the disadvantages of such virtual conferences - I eagerly look forward
to physical conferences, but I also think we should try to keep some
of the advantages of virtual conferences, such as much easier and
cheaper access for many more participants.
</p>

<p>
CADE has decided to move its proceedings to open access, and this
intend seems to be shared by our sister conferences. I have strongly
supported this move. We now have different attractive open-access
options, and I think we need to carefully balance impact and visibility
(in particular for younger researchers) vs. cost.
</p>

<p>
For the same reasons open access is valuable, I also think code of
systems described at CADE should be available - ideally in source code
under a free license. Many important implementation details and
techniques cannot be learned from a short paper, and replication of
results is essentially impossible without access to the code. I think
this should be at least strongly encouraged, and I will work towards
this for future conferences.
</p>

<p>
I am quite happy with the current schedule of alternating CADE and
IJCAR conferences, with a FLoC every 4 years. However, given the real,
environmental, and time cost of travel, it might be a good idea to
have more collocated events, as e.g. during the Vienna Summer of Logic
in 2014.
</p>

<h3 id="sophie">Nominee statement of Sophie Tourret</h3>

<p>
My current research interests span from explainable AI using abduction in description logics, to the formalization of theoretical frameworks for saturation-based calculi using Isabelle/HOL and the extension of first-order theorem proving techniques to higher-order logic.
</p>

<p>
I was involved in the organisation of CADE-28 as pc member and publicity chair, and I am a workshop chair for IJCAR 2022, as well as part of the steering comity of PAAR. I am or was also involved as a pc member in the neighbour conferences TABLEAU, CPP, AAAI and IJCAI.
</p>

<p>
I really enjoy the balance between theory and practice at CADE, as well as the friendly and open atmosphere of our community. As a CADE trustee, I will strive to preserve these strengths of ours, and to nurture the communication and interactions between the different components of our community, as I am already doing as the editor of the AAR newsletter. I will also support the ongoing process of moving to open access proceedings, as well as any endeavour to improve our reproducible research practices.
