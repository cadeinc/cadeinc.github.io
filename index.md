CADE is the major international forum at which research on all aspects of automated deduction is presented. The first conference was held in 1975. Previous CADEs were mostly biennial, and annual conferences started in 1996. Since 2001 CADE has participated in the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR).
