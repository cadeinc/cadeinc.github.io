### Procedure

The Herbrand award procedure (established 1992, amended 2001, updated 2019) 
has two stages: nomination and decision by the Herbrand award committee.
Nominations for this award can be made at any time to the president of CADE 
Inc. 
A nomination should include a letter (up to 2000 words) from a principal 
nominator describing the nominee's contributions (including the relationship 
to CADE), along with two other letters (up to 2000 words) of endorsement. 
Current members of the board of trustees of CADE Inc. (including ex-officio 
members) are not eligible. 
The nomination of a group of individuals who are collaborators is considered 
to be a single nomination, but all members of the group must be eligible. 
Nominations will be kept confidential.

The CADE trustees establish the Herbrand award committee. 
It is published upon its formation.
Nominators, nominees and authors of endorsement letters are not eligible for 
membership in the Herbrand award committee. 
The Herbrand award committee decides on the award.
