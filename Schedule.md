## Notes

 - A CADE conference is called "CADE-NN", where NN is the number of the conference and NOT the year, i.e., "CADE-22" is right, "CADE 2009" is wrong.
 - An IJCAR conference is called "IJCAR YYYY", where YYYY is the year.

In the following we use the term "conference" to mean both CADE and IJCAR.

## Budgeting

 - CADE Inc. underwrites each conference with CADE funds (i.e., what is in the account minus the money earmarked for IJCAR).

 - The registration package covers coffee breaks, welcome reception, the excursion, momento, and conference dinner for registered participants. Budget permitting and depending on circumstances, lunch could be included as well. All expenses should be receipted in a single receipt for "Conference registration", to allow easy processing of reimburement claims.

 - Administrative costs includes badges, bags ... any more?

 - Food and beverage is a large part of the budget, especially daily lunches. Hotels will typically open with a high bid, and there is room for negotiation. Tell them what you are prepared to spend, and ask them what they can offer for that amount. The same applies for banquets, excursions, etc. Remember, you have the money and the people, and must control the bartering.

 - Each conference budget must cover free registration and accommodation for the Herbrand Award recipient. The conference budget must also cover the cost of the Herbrand Award itself. The conference budget need not cover the recipient's travel costs - the award winner is supposed to use the award money for travel. (In exceptional circumstances CADE Inc may provide additional travel funds for the winner. In the final accounting for IJCAR conferences all expenses related to the Herbrand Award will be charged against CADE Inc. funds, because the award is from CADE and not from IJCAR.)
 
 - Each conference budget shoud cover the Woody Bledsoe travel awards, as best can be predicted based on past experience. However, the figures over the last years varied largely, between 10 and 20 recipients, equivalent of $4000 to $8000, so this is difficult.
 
 - There are normally 3 general conference invited speakers. Each gets rego waiver, and also their accomodation and travel costs are covered (economy class airfare).

 - Other waivers, e.g., chair, program chair, are typically not granted.

 - It is important to be mindful of hidden costs: shipping costs for proceedings can be substantial ($1000), conference insurance ($1000), audio-visual gear and internet, credit card costs, and costs for student helpers (free catering, proceedings, excursion ...?). Find out about any taxes that have to be paid. E.g. for sponsorship moneys coming from overseas?

 - CASC also involves some costs that need to be covered by the CASC registration fee (two data projectors, a room for a day, T-shirts, trophys, dinner). Typically the CASC registration fee is in the same ballpark as workshop registration.

 - The conference should not make a loss, when all expenses (all, including Herbrand Award and Bledsoe Award expenses) have been taken into account. Any surplus is given to CADE Inc.

 - Every conference chair must try to amortise costs through sponsorships.

 - You may want to ask previous conference organizers for their budget spreadsheets. Budget summaries from previous conferences are provided at the end of this guide.

## Organisation

 - Avoid contracting "professional" conference organizers. They're not worth the money.

 - Contracting a professional service to handle the registration process might be useful, though. For instance, www.conferenceonline.com prepares the registration pages in consultation with the organizer and collects all the payments. Peace of mind at reasonable costs, $10 per registrant. Experience with this particular company was somewhat mixed, though (difficulties understanding our needs, hiccups with the dollar calculations.)

 - If you plan to block book accomodation, be conservative to avoid penalties in case the block is not taken. This is especially true if the block is in an expensive hotel and there are plenty of cheaper options nearby. If you do block book, be sure to get pro rata freebie accomodation (1/50 is common) that can be used for invited speakers, etc. Also try find cheap accomodation for students, e.g., university residences, backpacker hostels, etc.

 - Trade exhibits, e.g., publishers, are welcome provided they do not incur any cost (direct or hidden, e.g., organizers time). In some cases trade exhibitors will offer sponsorship!

 - Find out if and how you can assist participants with obtaining a visa. Can you help providing evidence to the immigration department in your country that the participants are "trustworthy"? This may speed up things dramatically.

 - At the time of booking rooms for workshops and tutorials it will typically be uncertain how many of rooms you will need in the end. Try to negotiate a return and refund policy that suits your needs.

 - Before signing a substantial contract with a service provider, you may want to seek advice from your institution's legal department.

 - Be aware that there are occasional fraudulent registrations. If in doubt you can ask for scientific credentials on official letterhead.
