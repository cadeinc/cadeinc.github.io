The bylaws of CADE Inc govern the actions of CADE officers and the 
participation rights of the CADE membership. 
The bylaws were adopted at the business meeting during CADE-13 in 
New Brunswick, NJ, USA and are effective as of November 1, 1996. 
In July 2000 the CADE membership approved a change to the bylaws
"Subsection 2.0 Membership of Board of Trustees" to increase the number of
trustees from six to nine.
A proposed amendment of the CADE bylaws regarding the election of the CADE 
president (see AAR Newsletter No. 68, October 2005) did not pass because not 
enough AAR members voted.
At the CADE business meeting on Tuesday, July 17th, 2018 it was agreed by vote
(51 Yes, 1 No, 1 Abstain, quorum reached) that paying the CADE/IJCAR 
conference fee constitutes CADE membership for three years. 
This means the CADE voting community consists of all participants of the 
past 3 CADE conferences (including IJCAR).
In November 2019 the CADE membership approved a change to the bylaws 
"Subsection 2.3 Election of Trustees", from the use of the CADE Single 
Transferrable Vote system to use of a system that in the future will be 
specified in the CADE web pages.
That voting procedure has now been chosen:
The voting procedure for trustee elections is the Condorcet
completion Minimax-PM. It is the default voting system at
the Condorcet Internet Voting Service supported by Andrew Myers,

#### Section 11. The Transitional Period.

These bylaws shall go into effect 90 days after the close of the 1996 CADE conference. The Trustees in office at that time shall be divided into a group of two whose terms of office expire at CADE-14, a group of two whose terms of office expire at CADE-15, and a group of two whose terms of office expire at CADE-16; any remaining Trustees' terms of office will expire when these bylaws go into effect. The Trustees shall decide which of themselves belong to which of these groups. When these bylaws go into effect, two Trustees shall be elected at each CADE conference. All Trustees in office when these bylaws go into effect, and whose terms of office expire at CADE-14, will serve as non-voting Advisors to the Trustees for one year after CADE-14. By "non-voting" is meant that the Advisors do not vote at Trustee meetings (unless they are serving a term of office as a Trustee). Trustees whose terms of office expire at CADE-14, CADE-15, or CADE-16 may run for election when these bylaws go into effect. If their election occurs during or at the expiration of one of their terms of office as a Trustee, then they shall be considered as entering their second term of office, for purposes of the three-term rule. Otherwise, they shall be considered as entering their first term of office. In general, Trustees in office when these bylaws go into effect are subject to the three-term rule.
