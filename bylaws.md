The Association for Automated Reasoning (AAR) is a not-for-profit corporation whose objective is advancing the field of automated reasoning by means that include the dissemination of information to its members and the promotion of the exchange of information. This corporation will have the authority to incorporate other subcorporations.

The corporation AAR is subject to the following bylaws, and all other powers and provisions provided by law.

### Board of Directors

To be an officer of AAR, one must be a member of AAR. CADE is a not-for-profit subcorporation of AAR whose objective is to organize and hold conferences on automated reasoning.
