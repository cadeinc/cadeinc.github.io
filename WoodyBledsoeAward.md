The Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award was created to honor the memory of Woody Bledsoe, for his contributions to mathematics, artificial intelligence, and automated theorem proving, and for his dedication to students. The award is intended to enable selected students to attend the International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE) or the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR), whichever is scheduled for the year, by covering part of their expenses.

The winners of the Woody Bledsoe Student Award are partially reimbursed for their conference registration, transportation, and accommodation expenses. Preference is given to students who play an active role in the conference (including satellite workshops, competitions, tutorials and poster events), and do not have alternative funding. However, also students in other situations are also encouraged to apply.

A nomination consists of a recommendation letter of up to 300 words from the student's advisor.

The awards are presented at the conference. In case a winner does not attend, the chairs may transfer the award to another nominee or give no award.
