At every CADE conference the Program Committee selects one of the accepted papers to receive the CADE Best Paper Award. The award recognizes a paper that the Program Committee collegially evaluates as the best in terms of originality and significance, having substantial confidence in its correctness. Overall technical quality, completeness, scholarly accuracy, and readability are also considered. Characteristics associated with a best paper include, for instance, introduction of a strong new technique or approach, solution of a long-standing open problem, introduction and solution of an interesting and important new problem, highly innovative application of known ideas or existing techniques, and presentation of a new system of outstanding power. Under exceptional circumstances, the Program Committee may give two awards (ex aequo) or give no award. The CADE Best Paper Award is permanently established beginning with CADE-24 in 2013.
