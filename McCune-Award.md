In 2019 CADE Inc. established the Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning to distinguish each year a PhD thesis defended the previous year, for its substantive contributions to the field of Automated Reasoning, its theory, its implementation, and/or its application on important problems. The award is named after the American computer scientist William Walker McCune.

### Recipients

------------------------

### Procedure

At most one award is attributed for each year, but honorable mentions may also be announced at the discretion of the Expert Committee.

#### Eligibility

Eligible for the award are those who successfully defended their PhD
<UL>
<LI> at an academic institution;
<LI> in the field of Automated Reasoning;
<LI> in the period from January 1 to December 31 (for that year's award).
</UL>

#### Nomination

Candidates for the award must be nominated by their supervisor(s) and one additional independent researcher who reviewed/examined the thesis. The nomination must consist of a single PDF file containing
<UL>
<LI> a letter from the supervisor(s) describing why the thesis should be considered for the award and the relationship of the contributions to CADE/IJCAR;
<LI> a report from the nominating additional independent researcher who reviewed/examined the thesis;
<LI> the thesis itself;
<LI> a copy of the PhD diploma;
<LI> and copy/copies of CADE/IJCAR papers of the nominee, if any, containing results published in the thesis.
</UL>
Nominations must be submitted by March 15. 

#### Evaluation

The thesis will be evaluated with respect to its quality, originality and (potential) impact to the field of Automated Reasoning.
<UL>
<LI> The nominations will be evaluated and compared by an international Expert Committee (see below).
<LI> The procedure to be followed is analogous to the review phase of a conference. The justification by the supervisor and the nominating additional independent researcher report will play an important role in the evaluation.
<LI> The final decision is made by the Expert Committee at least one month before CADE/IJCAR being held.
<LI> The award consists of a certificate announcing the winner to have received the Bill McCune PhD Award in Automated Reasoning. The award will be announced at the respective year's CADE/IJCAR. The nominators of the winner will also receive a copy of this certificate.
<LI> The decision of the Expert Committee is final and binding, and not subject to discussion.
</UL>

#### Expert Committee

The Expert Committee, consisting of leading researchers in Automating Reasoning, is formed by the board of CADE Trustees with the aim to reflect the broad diversity in the area of Automated Reasoning. It is announced with the call for nominations, and thus formed before the call for nominations. The decision on the award is taken by the Expert Committee. The Expert Committee can seek additional expertise, even after the submission deadline for nominations. Expert Committee members cannot have a PhD student applying for the award.
